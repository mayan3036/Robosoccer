## Introduction
This project demonstrates the creation of a simple robot that can be controlled over Bluetooth. The Arduino is used to process the incoming Bluetooth commands and control the motors via the L298 motor driver. The HC-05 Bluetooth module establishes a wireless connection between the controlling device and the robot.

## Components
- Arduino (Arduino UNO or similar)
- L298 Motor Driver
- HC-05 Bluetooth Module
- Motors and Wheels
- Chassis for the Bot
- Power Source (Battery or Power Supply)

## Circuit Diagram


The circuit diagram depicts the connections between the Arduino, L298 Motor Driver, HC-05 Bluetooth Module, and the motors. Make sure to connect the components as shown in the diagram to ensure proper functionality.

## Installation
1. Clone this repository to your local machine using the following command:
git clone https://github.com/mayan3036/your-repo.git

2. Upload the Arduino code (`bluetooth_bot.ino`) to your Arduino board using the Arduino IDE.

## Usage
1. Assemble the bot according to the provided chassis design or your custom design.
2. Power up the bot using the appropriate power source.
3. Pair your smartphone or device with the HC-05 Bluetooth Module.
4. Open a Bluetooth terminal app on your smartphone.
5. Send the appropriate commands (e.g., "F" for forward, "B" for backward, "L" for left, "R" for right) from the terminal app to control the bot's movement.
